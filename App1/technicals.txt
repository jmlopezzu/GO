Great! Creating a web backend using Go is a fantastic way to explore the language's capabilities. Here's a basic guide to get you started with building a simple web server in Go:

### Step 1: Create a New Go Project

1. Create a new folder for your Go project.

   ```bash
   mkdir mywebapp
   cd mywebapp
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Go File

2. Create a new Go file, for example, `main.go`.

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "fmt"
       "net/http"
   )

   func main() {
       http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
       fmt.Println("Server is running on http://localhost:8080")
       http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
   }

   func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, Go Web!")
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Run Your Go Web Server

3. Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   Your web server should now be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You'll see "Hello, Go Web!" when you access this URL.

### Step 4: Explore Routing and Handling Requests

4. You can extend your web server by adding more routes and handling different types of HTTP requests. For example:

   ```go
   func main() {
       http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
       http.HandleFunc("/about", aboutHandler)
       fmt.Println("Server is running on http://localhost:8080")
       http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
   }

   func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, Go Web!")
   }

   func aboutHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       fmt.Fprintf(w, "About Page")
   }
   ```

   Now, accessing [http://localhost:8080/about](http://localhost:8080/about) will display "About Page."

### Step 5: Explore Third-Party Libraries (Optional)

5. Go has several third-party libraries for building web applications. One popular choice is Gorilla Mux for routing. You can install it using:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
   ```

   And then use it in your code:

   ```go
   import (
       "fmt"
       "net/http"
       "github.com/gorilla/mux"
   )

   func main() {
       r := mux.NewRouter()
       r.HandleFunc("/", handler)
       r.HandleFunc("/about", aboutHandler)

       http.Handle("/", r)

       fmt.Println("Server is running on http://localhost:8080")
       http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
   }
   ```

   Gorilla Mux provides more advanced routing capabilities.

Congratulations! You've created a simple Go web server. From here, you can continue exploring more advanced topics such as middleware, handling static files, integrating with databases, and building RESTful APIs. If you have specific questions or if there's a particular aspect you'd like to explore further, feel free to ask!

It looks like you are encountering an issue related to Go modules. Starting from Go 1.11, Go introduced the concept of modules for dependency management. If you are working with a project outside of the Go module system, you might encounter this kind of error.

Here's how you can proceed:

### Option 1: Use `go mod init` to Create a Module

If your project is not already using Go modules, you can initialize it with the following steps:

1. In your project directory, run the following command to initialize a Go module:

   ```bash
   go mod init <module-name>
   ```

   Replace `<module-name>` with your desired module name. For example:

   ```bash
   go mod init mywebapp
   ```

   This will create a `go.mod` file in your project directory.

2. After initializing the module, you can use `go get` to install packages. For example:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
   ```

### Option 2: Move to a Directory Within a Go Module

If you are already within a Go module, make sure you are in a directory that is part of the module. You can check for the existence of a `go.mod` file.

1. Navigate to the root of your Go module (where the `go.mod` file is located).

2. Run the `go get` command from there:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
   ```

Remember to replace `<module-name>` with the actual name of your module if you are using Option 1.

After following one of these options, you should be able to install the Gorilla Mux package successfully within your Go module.
